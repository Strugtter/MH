            The airline was founded on October 2, 1980, starting operations on
            February 23, 1981, with a few small planes, until they acquired
            some
            Embraer 110 Bandeirante and Fairchild F27. In 1990, the airline
            registered a 9% decrease in passenger transport. With the rise of
            competition with AeroRep√∫blica in November 1992, AIRES made small
            expansions, mostly adding service to the neighboring countries of
            Venezuela and Ecuador
